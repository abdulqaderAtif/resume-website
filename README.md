# Personal Resume Website

This is my personal one-page resume website built for the CCSW321 – Web Development course.
The website is fully written using HTML5 and CSS3, with an additional Bootstrap component.

The goal of this project is to present my resume in a clean and responsive layout, while demonstrating my understanding of:

- Semantic HTML structure

- External CSS styling

- Responsive web design

- Web accessibility

- Basic Bootstrap components

- GitHub Pages deployment
